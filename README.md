## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

When using CY8CKIT-062XXX as the target, connect the PDM microphone externally on P10.5 and P10.4 pins. This can be done by plugging in the [CY8CKIT-028-EPD](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/e-ink-display-shield-board-cy8ckit-028-epd) E-INK Shield Display board to the board’s Arduino headers.

It also requires a microSD card placed to the SD card slot to properly run a file system.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example uses the [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) tool to import raw audio data stored in the external memory. You can also use any software tool that is able to import raw audio data.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure Boot" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Insert a microSD card in the SD slot. Refer to the kit's guide to its location.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

   **Note:** Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the title of the code example and some additional messages are printed as shown below:

      ```
      ************* CE230360 - PSoC 6 MCU: USB Mass Storage File System *************


      Creating a new config.txt file... done!

      List of records:
      <Empty>
      ```

6. If any error occurs on creating files or folders, you can force the firmware to format the file system:

   1. Keep the kit user button pressed, and then press the kit reset button.

   2. Release the kit user button after a few seconds.

       The following message is displayed:

      ```
      ************* CE230360 - PSoC 6 MCU: USB Mass Storage File System *************


      Formatting file system... done!

      Creating new config.txt file... done!

      List of records:
      <Empty>
      ```

7. Record the audio data to the file system:

   1. Press the kit user button to start audio recording.

      The kit LED should turn on indicating that the device is recording.

   2. Press the kit user button again to stop audio recording.

      The following message is displayed:

      ```
      Started a new record with:
      SAMPLE_RATE = 48000
      SAMPLE_MODE = stereo
      -- Record ended ---
      File created: PSOC_RECORDS/rec_0001.raw
      ```

8. Connect another USB cable (or reuse the same cable used to program the kit) to the USB device block connector (see the kit user guide for its location). Note that the enumeration process might take a few seconds.

9. On the computer, verify that the OS recognizes a new portable device.

   If the device does not recognize a file system, you can force the firmware to format it, as described in Step 5.

10. Open the Audacity software and do the following:

   1. Go to **File** > **Import** > **Raw Data...**.

   2. Navigate to the USB drive and select the *PSOC_RECORDS/rec_0001.raw* file (or any other in the *PSOC_RECORDS* folder). Note that reading from the USB drive might take a few seconds, especially if the file is very large.

      By default, the sample rate is set to be *48000 Hz* and sample mode to *stereo*. The **Encoding** is fixed to *Signed 16-bit PCM* and **Byte order** to *Little-endian*, as shown in Figure 1.

      **Figure 1. Import window**

      ![Import window](images/import_window.png)

   3. Once imported, play the recorded data to your computer speaker.

11. (Optional) Edit the *config.txt* file in the USB drive to change the sample settings.

     For example, change the content as shown below:

      ```
      # Set the sample rate in Hertz
      SAMPLE_RATE_HZ=16000

      # Sample mode (stereo, mono)
      SAMPLE_MODE=mono
      ```

12. Press the kit user button to start audio recording again. Stop after a few seconds. The following message is displayed:

      ```
      Started a new record with:
      SAMPLE_RATE = 16000
      SAMPLE_MODE = mono
      -- Record ended ---
      File created: PSOC_RECORDS/rec_0002.raw
      ```

13. Repeat Step 9, but set the sample rate to *16000 Hz* and sample mode to *mono*.

In addition to manipulating the recorded files, you can copy new files, create folders, and delete content in the USB drive through the OS as any other storage device.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

This code example uses the FreeRTOS on the CM4 CPU. The following tasks are created in *main.c*:

- **Audio task:** handles the creation of audio records.
- **USB task:** handles the USB communication.

The firmware also uses a mutex (`rtos_fs_mutex`) to control accesses to the file system by these two tasks. FatFs is the chosen file system library to enable manipulating files in this code example. The FatFs library files are located in the *fatfs* folder. The low-level layer used by the library to access the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU driver is implemented in the *fatfs/disk.c* file. PSoC&trade; 6 MCU uses the SD Host interface to communicate with the microSD card. The *sd_card.c/h* files implement a wrapper to the SD Host driver.

In the *USB task*, the USB device block is configured to use the MSC Device Class. The task constantly checks if any USB requests are received. It bridges the USB with the file system, allowing the computer to view all files in the microSD card. The *usb_msc* folder contains all the related USB implementation as follows:

File | Description
----|---------
*usb_scsi.h/c* |  Implements the USB SCSI protocol, which is used by the USB MSC device class
*usb_comm.h/c* | Implements the USB MSC device class requests
*cy_usb_dev_msc.h/c* | Implements the USB Device middleware for the USB MSC device class (these files will eventually move to *usbdev.lib*)

In the *Audio task*, the firmware initializes the audio file system. It checks whether a FAT file system is available in the external memory. If not, it formats the memory and create a new FAT file system. It also creates a default *config.txt* file that contains audio settings, and a folder called *PSOC_RECORDS* to store new audio records. You can also force a format of the file system by pressing the kit user button during the initialization of the firmware (after a power-on-reset (POR) or hardware reset).

The *config.txt* file allows you to edit two settings - sample rate and sample mode. The recommended audio sample rates are 8, 16, 32, and 48 kHz. The sample mode can be mono or stereo. This file can be modified through the computer once the device enumerates as a portable device.

The *Audio task* also checks for kit button presses, which can start or stop audio recording, depending on the current state. An LED turns on when audio recording is in progress. When a new record starts, the firmware creates new file in the *PSOC_RECORDS* folder. It starts as *rec_0001.raw*. If the file already exists, it increases the number on the file name and attempts again to create the file. If it succeeds, it gets the sample settings from *config.txt* and initializes the [PDM/PCM](https://sdkdocs.cypress.com/html/psoc6-with-anycloud/en/latest/api/psoc-base-lib/hal/group__group__hal__pdmpcm.html) block based on that.

Once audio recording is in progress, the PDM/PCM block generates periodic interrupts to the CPU, indicating that new audio data is available. A ping-pong mechanism is implemented to avoid any corruption between the data the PDM/PCM block generates and the data the firmware manipulates. Once the data is available, the *Audio task* writes the raw audio data to the open *rec_xxxx.raw* file.

When you press the kit user button again, the audio recording stops and the file is saved. You can access this file through the USB Mass Storage device and use a software like Audacity to import it and play it. Figure 2 shows the flowchart of the *Audio task*.

   **Figure 2. Audio task flowchart**

   ![Flowchart](images/flowchart.png)
   
To view the mass storage descriptor, use the *usbdev-configurator* tool located at *<ModusToolbox™ software install directory>/tools_<version>/usbdev-configurator*. In the tool, open the *design.cyusbdev* file located under the */COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/<target>* folder.
